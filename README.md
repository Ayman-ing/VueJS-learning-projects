## About Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, making it easy to integrate into existing projects or start new ones. Vue.js features a simple and intuitive API, reactive data binding, component-based architecture, and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
